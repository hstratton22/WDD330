        <h3>Fetch notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fetch API<br>
                provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline,
                such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy,
                logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.</li>
            <li>Differes from ajax<br>
                The Promise returned from fetch() won’t reject on HTTP error status even if the response is an HTTP 404
                or 500. Instead, it will resolve normally (with ok status set to false), and it will only reject on
                network failure or if anything prevented the request from completing.
                fetch() won’t send cross-origin cookies unless you set the credentials init option. (Since April 2018.
                The spec changed the default credentials policy to same-origin. Firefox changed since 61.0b13.)
            </li>
            <li>mode: "no-cors" only allows a limited set of headers in the request: <br>
                Accept<br>
                Accept-Language<br>
                Content-Language<br>
                Content-Type with a value of application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, or text/plain
            </li>
            <li>clone()<br>
                There is also a clone() method that creates a copy. Both methods of creating a copy will fail if the
                body of the original request or response has already been read, but reading the body of a cloned
                response or request will not cause it to be marked as read in the original.
            </li>
            <li>Headers<br>
                Interface allows you to create your own headers object via the Headers() constructor. A headers object
                is a simple multi-map of names to values</li>
            <li>TypeError<br>
                Thrown if a header name is used that is not a valid HTTP Header name. </li>
            <li>Guard property<br>
                possible values<br>
                none: default.<br>
                request: guard for a headers object obtained from a request (Request.headers).<br>
                request-no-cors: guard for a headers object obtained from a request created with Request.mode
                no-cors.<br>
                response: guard for a headers object obtained from a response (Response.headers).<br>
                immutable: guard that renders a headers object read-only; mostly used for ServiceWorkers.<br>
                Note: You may not append or set the Content-Length header on a guarded headers object for a response.
                Similarly, inserting Set-Cookie into a response header is not allowed: ServiceWorkers are not allowed to
                set cookies via synthesized responses.

            </li>
            <li>Response objects<br>
                response properties<br>
                Response.status — An integer (default value 200) containing the response status code.<br>
                Response.statusText — A string (default value ""), which corresponds to the HTTP status code message.
                Note that HTTP/2 does not support status messages.<br>
                Response.ok — seen in use above, this is a shorthand for checking that status is in the range 200-299
                inclusive. This returns a Boolean.<br>
                The static method error() returns an error response. Similarly, redirect() returns a response resulting
                in a redirect to a specified URL. These are also only relevant to Service Workers.
            </li>
            
            <li>Body<br>
                Both requests and responses may contain body data. A body is an instance of any of the following
                types:<br>
                ArrayBuffer<br>
                ArrayBufferView (Uint8Array and friends)<br>
                Blob/File<br>
                string<br>
                URLSearchParams<br>
                FormData<br>
            </li>
            <li>The Body mixin defines the following methods to extract a body (implemented by both Request and
                Response). These all return a promise that is eventually resolved with the actual content.<br>
                arrayBuffer()<br>
                blob()<br>
                json()<br>
                text()<br>
                formData()<br>

            </li>

            <li>FYI-Blob<br>
                A blob is a data type that can store binary data. This is different than most other data types used in
                databases, such as integers, floating point numbers, characters, and strings, which store letters and
                numbers. Since blobs can store binary data, they can be used to store images or other multimedia files.
