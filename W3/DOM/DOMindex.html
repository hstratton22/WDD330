        <h3>Notes Wk3 DOM</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="heroes.html">heroes (see console log)</a> </li>
            <li>Dynamic HTML<br>
                focus on common page elements such as images, links and forms (DOM level 0)</li>
                <li>the DOM also stores any whitespace that is in the HTML document as text nodes.</li>
                <li>Shortcuts<br>
                    Document.body returns the body element of a web page, as we saw in the previous example.<br>

                    Document.images returns a node list of all the images contained in the document.<br>
                   
                    Document.links returns a node list of all the <a> elements and <area> elements that have an href attribute.<br>
                   
                    Document.anchors returns a node list of all the <a> elements that have a name attribute.<br>
                   
                    Document.forms returns a node list of all the forms in the document.</li>
                    <li>Node lists are array-like objects, but they are not arrays.<br>
                        document.images[0]<br>
                        for (let i=0 ; i < document.images.length ; i++) {
                            // do something with each image using document.images[i]
                            }<br>
                        but no slice , splice and join</li>
                        <li>The toggle method is a particularly useful method that will add a class if an element doesnâ€™t 
                            have it already, andremovethe class if it does have it. It returns true if the class was added 
                            and false if it was removed. </li>
                            <li>To create new element with text content<br>
                                Create the element node<br>
                                Create the text node<br> 
                                Append the text node to the element node</li>
                                <li>If an element is required to appear in several different places in the document, it would need to be cloned before each insertion.</li>
