        <h3>Notes Wk3 objects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Objects are assigned by reference</li>
            <li>JSON<br>
                Property names must be double-quoted<br>
                Permitted values are double-quoted strings, numbers, true, false, null, arrays and objects<br>
                Functions are not permitted values<br></li>
                <li>Date<br>
                    Remember that computer programs start counting at zero, so January is 0, February is 1, 
                    and so on up to December, which is 11.<br>
                    The Epoch is 1st January 1970.<br>
                    Themoment.js library gives a large number of methods that make it easier to work with dates, 
                    as well as support for multiple locales.</li>
                    <li>RegExp<br>
                        The global property makes the pattern return all matches. By default, the pattern only looks 
                        for the first occurrence of a match. (g)<br>
                        The ignoreCase property makes the pattern case-insensitive. By default, they are case sensitive. (i)<br>
                        The multiline property makes the pattern multiline. By default, a pattern will stop at the end of a line. (m)<br>
                        
                        </li>
                        <li>Special Characters<br>
                            . matches any character, except line breaks<br>

                            \w matches any word character, and is equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9_]<br>
                           
                            \W matches any non-word character, and is equivalent to [\^A-Za-z0-9_]<br>
                           
                            \d matches any digit character, and is equivalent to [0-9]<br>
                           
                            \D matches any non-digit character, and is equivalent to [^0-9]<br>
                           
                            \s matches any whitespace character, and is equivalent to [ \t\r\n\f]<br>
                           
                            \S matches any non-whitespace character, and is equivalent to [^ \t\r\n\f]<br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Modifiers<br>
                            Modifiers can be placed after a token to deal with multiple occurrences of that token:

                            ? makes the preceding token in the regular expression optional<br>

                            * matches one or more occurrences of the preceding token<br>

                            + matches one or more occurrences of the preceding token<br>

                            {n} matches n occurrences of the preceding token<br>

                            {n,} matches at least n occurrences of the pattern<br>

                            {,m} matches at most m occurrences of the preceding token<br>

                            {n,m} matches at leastnand at mostmoccurrences of the preceding token<br>

                            ^ marks the position immediately before the first character in the string<br>

 $                           marks the position immediately after the last character in the string<br>
                        </li>
