        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="events.html">events page</a>
            </li>
            <li>The screenX and screenY properties show the number of pixels from the 
                left and top of the screen respectively where the event took place.
            </li>
            <li>The clientX and clientY properties show the number of pixels from the 
                left and top of the client that is being used (usually the browser window).
            </li>
            <li>
                The pageX and pageY properties show the number of pixels from the left and 
                top, respectively, where the event took place in thedocument. This property 
                takes account of whether the page has been scrolled.
            </li>
            <li>Key evnets<br>
                The keydown event occurs when a key is pressed and willcontinue to occurif the key is held down.<br>
                The keypress event occurs after a keydown event but before a keyup event. The keypress event only 
                occurs for keys that produce character input (plus the 'Delete' key). This means that it’s the most 
                reliable way to find out the character that was pressed on the keyboard.<br>
                The keyup event occurs when a key is released.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Pressing the modifier keys such as Shift,Ctrl,Alt and meta(Cmd on Mac) will fire the keydown and keyup events, 
                but not the keypress event as they don't produce any characters on the screen.
            </li>
            <li><touchstart<br>
            Be careful when using the touchstart event as it fires as soon as a user touches the screen. They may be touching 
            the screen because they want to zoom in or swipe, and a touchstart event listener could prevent them from doing this.
            The click event is often a much safer option as it still fires when the screen is touched, but there’s a slight delay 
            of 300ms, allowing the user time to perform another action with the device. The click event can be thought of as a "tap" 
            in the context of a touch event.</li>
            <li>
                The touchmove event occurs after a user has touched the screen then moves around without leaving. It will continue 
                to occur as long as the user is still touching the screen, even if they leave the element to which the event listener is attached.<br>
                The touchenter event occurs when a user has already started touching the surface, but then passes over the element to which the event 
                listener is attached.<br>
                The touchleave event occurs when the user is still touching the surface, but leaves the element to which the event listener is attached.<br>
                The touchcancel event occurs when a touch event is interrupted, such as a user’s finger moving outside the document wi
                fingers being used at once. A pop-up dialog will also cancel a touch event.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Hammer.JS or zingtouch libraries make events such as swipe, pinch and rotate easy to implement.</li>
            <li>Bubbling<br>
                Bubbling is when the event fires on the element clicked on first, then bubbles up the document tree, 
                firing an event on each parent element until it reaches the root node.</li>
            <li>Capturing<br>
                Capturing starts by firing an event on the root element, then propagates downwards, firing an event 
                on each child element until it reaches the target element that was clicked on.</li>
