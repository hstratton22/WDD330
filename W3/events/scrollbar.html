    //The following example draws a progress bar above the

    document.body.appendChild(document.createTextNode(
      "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious ".repeat(1000)));
  
    let bar = document.querySelector("#progress");
    window.addEventListener("scroll", () => {
      let max = document.body.scrollHeight - innerHeight;
      bar.style.width = `${(pageYOffset / max) * 100}%`;
    });
    /*but also prevents it from scrolling along with the rest of the document. 
    The effect is to make our progress bar stay at the top. Its width is changed 
    to indicate the current progress. We use %, rather than px, as a unit when setting 
    the width so that the element is sized relative to the page width.

    The global innerHeight binding gives us the height of the window, which we have to 
    subtract from the total scrollable height—you can’t keep scrolling when you hit the 
    bottom of the document. There’s also an innerWidth for the window width. By dividing 
    pageYOffset, the current scroll position, by the maximum scroll position and multiplying 
    by 100, we get the percentage for the progress bar.

    Calling preventDefault on a scroll event does not prevent the scrolling from happening. 
    In fact, the event handler is called only after the scrolling takes place.*/
