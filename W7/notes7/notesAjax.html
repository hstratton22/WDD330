        <h3>Ajax</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                CORS-Cross-origin resource sharing
            </li>
            <li>AJAX-Asybchormoous JavaScript and XML</li>
            <li>API-application programming interface</li>
            <li>Fetch API<br>
                The Fetch API uses promises to avoid callback hell, and also streamlines a number of concepts that had become cumbersome when using the XMLHttpRequest object.
            </li>
            <li>HTTP status code<br>
            200-successful<br>
            201-resource was created<br>
            204-request successful but no content returned<br>
            ok-between 200 and 299
        </li>
        <li>Response object properties<br>
            headers – A Headers object (see later section) containing any headers associated with the response<br>
            url – A string containing the URL of response<br>
            redirected – A boolean value that specifies if the response is the result of a redirect<br>
            type – A string value of 'basic', 'cors', 'error' or 'opaque'. A value of 'basic' is used for a response 
            from the same domain. A value of 'cors' means the data was received from a valid cross-origin request from 
            a different domain. A value of 'opaque' is used for a response received from 'no-cors' request from another domain, 
            which means access to the data will be severely restricted. A value of 'error' is used when a network error occurs.
        </li>
        <li>Redirects<br>
        </li>
        <li>Request Constructor<br>
            url – The URL of the requested resource (the only property that is required).<br>
            method – a string that specifies which HTTP method should be used for the request. By default, this is 'GET'.<br>
            headers – This is a Headers object (see later section) that provides details of the request's headers.<br>
            mode – Allows you to specify if CORS is used or not. CORS is enabled by default.<br>
            cache – Allows you to specify how the request will use the browser's cache. For example, you can force it to request a 
            resource and update the cache with the result, or you can force it to only look in the cache for the resource.<br>
            credentials – Lets you specify if cookies should be allowed with the request.<br>
            redirect – Specifies what to do if the response returns a redirect. There’s a choice of three values: 'follow' 
            (the redirect is followed), 'error' (an error is thrown) or 'manual' (the user has to click on a link to follow the redirect).
        </li>
        <li>HTTP Transfers<br>
            GET (default)requests to retrieve resources<br>

            POST requests, usually used to create a resource but can actually perform any task<br>
            
            PUT requests toupsert, which means insert a resource or update it entirely<br>
            
            PATCH requests to make partial updates to a resource<br>
            
            DELETE requests to delete a resources.</li>
            <li>Headers<br>
                HTTP headers are used to pass on any additional information about a request or response. 
                Typical information contained in headers includes the file-type of the resource, cookie information, 
                authentication information and when the resource was last modified.
