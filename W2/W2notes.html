        <ul>
            <li>see js practice in console</li>
            <li>9 falsy Boolean<br>
                "", '' ,``, 0, -0, NaN, false, null, undefined</li>

            </li>
            <li>NaN === NaN;<< false<br>
                NaN is the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself! To deal with this, there is a special Number method called Number.isNaN()
            </li>
            <li>
                Weak Sets<br>When objects are added to sets, they will be stored there as long 
                as the set exists, even if the original reference to the object is 
                removed. The technical term for this is the object is prevented from 
                being garbage-collected, which can cause a memory leak. 
            </li>
            <li>To use the rest operator, simply place three dots in front of the last parameter 
                in a function declaration. This will then collect all the arguments entered into an array.
            </li>
            <li>Arrow Functions<br>Arrow functions can be identified by the 'arrow' symbol, => that gives 
                them their name. The parameters come before the arrow and the main body of the function comes 
                after. Arrow functions are always anonymous, so if you want to refer to them, you must assign 
                them to a variable. <br>
                advantages:<br>
                •	They are much less verbose than normal function declarations.<br>
                •	Single parameters don't need putting into parentheses.<br>
                •	The body of the function doesn't need placing inside a block if it's only one line.<br>
                •	The return keyword isn't required if the return statement is the only statement in the body of the function.<br>
                •	They don't bind their own value of this to the function <br>
            </li>
            <li>Hoisting<br>
                Variable declarations that use the var keyword are automatically 
                moved to the top of the current scope. Variable assignment is not hoisted, 
                however. This means that a variable assigned at the end of a function will 
                have a value of undefined until the assignment is made.
            </li>
            <li>callback<br>
                A function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a callback.
            </li>
        </ul>
