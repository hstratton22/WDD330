        <ul>
            <li>9 falsy Boolean<br>
                "", '' ,``, 0, -0, NaN, false, null, undefined</li>

            </li>
            <li>NaN === NaN;<< false<br>
                NaN is the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself! To deal with this, there is a special Number method called Number.isNaN()

            <li>
                Weak Sets<br>When objects are added to sets, they will be stored there as long 
                as the set exists, even if the original reference to the object is 
                removed. The technical term for this is the object is prevented from 
                being garbage-collected, which can cause a memory leak.
