        <h3>Transforms and transitions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Transform<br>
                translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element </li>
            <ul>

                <li>Translation<br>
                    moving elements up and down or left and right along the x and y axesfrom current position<br>
                    transform: translate(45px, -45px);
                </li>
                <li>Scaling<br>
                    scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. If only one value is
                    provided,
                    it will be used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element
                    while
                    maintaining the original aspect ratio.
                    Default the point of origin is the element’s center.<br>
                    transform: scale(1.5, 0.25);
                </li>
                <li>Rotation<br>
                    rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value. Default the point of
                    origin is
                    the element’s center. Degrees, grads, radians, or turns.
                </li>
                <li>Skew<br>
                    transform: skew(15deg, 4deg);
                </li>
                <li>Transform-origin<br>
                    transform-origin: 0 0;
                    transform-origin: 50% 50%;//default
                    transform-origin: 10% 10%;
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Transition<br>
                allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations.<br>
                Steps:<br>
                Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.<br>
                Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.<br>
                Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties,
                including: transition-property , transition-duration , transition-timing-function , and
                transition-delay.<br>
                <br>
                The exception to this “if there is a valid midpoint, it can be transitioned” rule is visibility:
                although there is no
                valid midpoint between the values visible and hidden , when transitioned, the value changes at the
                endpoint of the transition.
            </li>
            <li>Transition-duration<br>
                Sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to
                the transitioned state.
                You can specify this either in seconds ( s ) or milliseconds ( ms ).
            </li>
            <li>Transition-timing-functions<br>
                ease: slow start, then speeds up, and ends slowly<br>
                ease-in-out: similar to ease but accelerates more sharply at beginning<br>
                linear: creates a transition that animates at a constant speed, same as (cubic-bezier(0, 0, 1, 1))<br>
                ease-in: slow to start but gains speed, and ends abruptly<br>
                ease-out: starts full speed then slows progressively until conclusion of transition<br>
                steps<br>
                define the number of steps and the direction of either start or end<br>
                For example, steps(5, start) would jump through the equidistant steps of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%, and
                steps(5, end) would jump
                throught the equidistant steps of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%.
            </li>
            <li>transition-delay<br>
                negative delays<br>
                a negative time delay that’s less than the duration of the entire transition will cause it to start
                immediately, but it will start partway through the animation.
            </li>
            <li>Animations<br>
                @-webkit-keyframes myAnimation { <br>
                /* put animation keyframes here */<br>
                }<br>
                @keyframes myAnimation { <br>
                /* put animation keyframes here */<br>
                }<br>
                from/to: evaluate to 0% and 100% respectively. <br>

            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>keyframe</li>
                <li>Animation Properties<br>
                    animation-name:appearDisapper(no quotes around name)<br>
                    animation-duration:300ms<br>
                    animation-timing-function:linear<br>
                    options: ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, a developer-defined cubic-bezier() function,
                    step-start, step-end, or a developer-defined number of steps with the steps(number, direction)
                    function
                </li>
                <li>
                    animation-iteration-count<br>
                    how many times the animation will play through. Use interger, decimal for partial complete  or infinite. Default is 1.
                </li>
                <li>animation-direction<br>
                reverse, alternate, alternate-reverse<br>
                When animations are played in reverse, timing functions are also reversed; for example, ease-in becomes ease-out .
            </li>
            <li>animation-delay<br>
                how many milliseconds or seconds to wait before the browser begins the animation:
            </li>
            <li>animation-fill-mode<br>
                defines what happens before the first animation iteration begins and after the last animation iteration concludes<br>
                none: default<br>
                forwards: hold the element at the last keyframe, with last keyframe property values overriding the element's original property values, without 
                reverting to the original values at the conclusion of the last animation iteration <br>
                The animation continues to apply the values of the last keyframes after the animation end<br>
                backwards: sit and wait on the first keyframe from the moment the animation is applied to the element, through the duration of the animation delay, 
                until the animation starts iterating <br>
                The animation’s initial keyframes are applied as soon as the animation style is applied to an element. <br>

                both:<br>
            </li>
            <li>animation-play-state<br>
            running or paused
        </li>
        <li>shorthand<br>
            .verbose {<br>
                animation-name: appearDisappear; <br>
                animation-duration: 300ms; <br>
                animation-timing-function: ease-in;<br>
                animation-iteration-count: 1;<br>
                animation-direction: alternate;<br>
                animation-delay: 5s;<br>
                animation-fill-mode: backwards;<br>
                animation-play-state: running;<br>
            }<br>
            /* shorthand */<br>
            .concise {<br>
                animation: 300ms ease-in alternate 5s backwards appearDisappear;<br>
            }<br>
            (left out the animation-iteration-count and animation-play-state since both were set to default.)
        </li>
        <li>*<br>
            If using the shorthand property, be careful with your animation-name . You want to avoid accidentally 
            using any animation property key term such as forwards , running , or alternate . Those three key terms 
            in particular have caused many developers hours of debugging. If you include a key term, the browser will 
            assume that the first occurrence of a valid value for any of the longhand properties is the value for that 
            property, not the value for the animation-name property.
