            <li>data-Attribute<br>
                a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. <br>
                Start with data- <br>
                Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores.<br>
                Include an optional string value.<br>
            </li>

            <li>web storage API<br>
                local storage and session storage<br>
                Differences from cookies:<br>
                Information stored isnotshared with the server on every request.<br>

                Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only if the domain is the same).<br>

                Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies ( There is no actual limit in the
                specification, but most browsers have a limit set at 5GB per domain.).<br>

                Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies. This potentially makes cookies a
                better choice for something like showing a popup once a day.</li>
            <li>storage event<br>
                only fired on anyotherwindows or tabs from the same domain, and only if the value of the item being
                saved changes. <br>
                key tells us the key of the item that changed<br>

                newValue tells us the new value to which it has been changed<br>

                oldValue tells us the previous value before it was changed<br>

                storageArea tells us if it is stored in local or session storage.</li>
            <li>Geolocation API<br>
                The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. This means it can be used
                to find the user’s exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is
                moving. This information can then be used to filter data based on the user's location or speed and
                direction of travel. An example of this might be a search function that returns results based on your
                location. Because of privacy concerns, permission to use this has to be granted by the user first.<br>
                getCurrentPosition()<br>
                youAreHere()<br>
                position.speed property returns the ground speed of the device in meters per second.<br>

                position.altitude property returns an estimate of the device’s altitude in meters above the WGS84
                ellipsoid, which is a standard measurement for the center of the Earth.<br>

                position.heading property returns the direction the device is moving in. This is measured as a bearing
                in degrees, clockwise from North.<br>

                position.timestamp property returns the time that the position information was recorded.<br>
                position.accuracy property returns the accuracy of the latitude and longitude properties in meters
                (lower the returned value, the more accurate the measurements are)<br>
                watchPosition() method that will call a callback function every time the position of the device is
                updated. <br>
                clearWatch() method can be used to stop the callback being called, using the ID of the watch as an
                argument<br>
            </li>
            <li>Web Workers API<br>
                allow processes to be run in the background</li>
            <li> <a href="factors/factors.html" >factors.html</a> </li>
            <li>Shared Web Workers<br>
                allow lots of different scripts on the same domain to access the same worker object.</li>
            <li>Service Workers API<br>
                allows a worker script to run in the background with the added benefit of being able to intercept
                network requests.
                This allows you to take alternative action if the network is offline, and effectively create app-like
                offline experiences. Service workers also allow access to push notifications and background syncing.
                Service workers require a secure network to run on HTTPS to avoid any malicious code hijacking network
                requests.

            </li>
            <li>Websocket<br>
                allows two-way communication with a server – also known as push messaging. This means that a connection
                is kept open and responses are ‘pushed’ to the client as soon as they are received.
            </li>
            <li><a href="websocket/websocket.html">websocket.html</a> </li>
            <li>Notifications API<br>
                allows you to show messages using the system's notifications. This is usually a popup in the corner of
                the screen, but it changes depending on the operating system. An advantage of using the system
                notification is that they will still be displayed even if the web page that calls them isn't the current
                tab.<br>
                requestPermission() to get permission for notifications
            </li>
            <li>Multimedia<br>
                The play event, which fires when the clip starts and when it resumes after a pause.<br>

                The pause event, which fires when the clip is paused.<br>

                The volumechange event, which fires when the volume is changed.<br>

                The loadedmetadata event, which we saw in the note above, and which fires when all the video's metadata
                has loaded.
