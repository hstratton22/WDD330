import HikesController from './hikesController.js';
//on load grab the array and insert it into the page
const myHikesController = new HikesController('hikes');
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
  myHikesController.showHikeList();
});
/*
The next step is to let our HTML know about our modules. 
In the index.js file import in your Controller, create an 
instance of the class, then call the showHikeList() method. 
You may want to console.log something out from that method 
until we create it to help us know if everything is working 
correctly. If there are errors, fix them :) If not move on to 
the next step. Make sure that showHikeList() does not get called 
before the DOM is ready.
The last step is go back in our model, view, and controller and 
finish writing the methods as indicated in the comments. I would 
recommend starting with the Model. Complete the getAllHikes method 
first (model), test it, then move on to the showAllHikes and renderHikeList 
methods. Test again.

After that work on the controller or View methods as it makes sense. I would 
recommend following the same order...finish a method, then test. It will keep 
your errors under control and make your code easier to troubleshoot.*/
