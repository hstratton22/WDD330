        <h3>Week5 Debugging notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>See console</li>
            <li>System Error<br>
                There’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.
            </li>
            <li>Programmer error<br>
                The program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.
            </li>
            <li>User error<br>
                The user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.
            </li>
            <li>Exception<br>
                An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with
                the error.
            </li>
            <li>Stack Trace<br>
                a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.
                A stack trace will work backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original
                function or method that started the sequence.
            </li>
            <li>Warning<br>
                A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash.
                This means the program will continue to run after a warning. This might sound good, but it can be
                problematic, since the issue that produced the warning may cause the program to continue running
                incorrectly.
            </li>
            <li>Strict Mode<br>
                'use strict'; as first line of code. <br>
                Produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features. Considers
                coding practices that were previously accepted as just being 'poor style' as actual errors.
            </li>
            <li>Linting Tools<br>
                They are designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain if
                certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented. They can be very unforgiving
                and use some opinionated coding conventions.
            </li>
            <li>Feature Detection<br>
                The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use feature detection. This is done
                using an if statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying to actually call the
                method.
                if (window.holoDeck) {
                virtualReality.activate();
                }
            </li>
            <li>Modernizr for feature detection and CanIUse? for browser support.
            </li>
            <li>Debugging in Browser<br>
                alert()<br>
                console.log()<br>
                breakpoint, debugger;
            </li>
            <li>Error Objects<br>
                Can be created by host environment or created in code with constructor function<br>
                const error = new Error('Oops, something went wrong');<br>
            <li>

                EvalError is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards
                compatibility. It was used to identify errors when using the global eval() function.<br>

                RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.<br>

                ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. For example, calling a
                function that hasn't been defined.<br>

                SyntaxError is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.<br>

                TypeError is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when
                a number is expected.<br>

                URIError is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.<br>

                InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. A
                common cause of this too much recursion.<br>
            </li>
            These error objects can also be used as constructors to create custom error objects:<br>
            const error = new TypeError('You need to use numbers in this function');

            </li>
            <li>The name property returns the name of the error constructor function used as a string, such as 'Error'
                or 'ReferenceError'.<br>

                The message property returns a description of the error and should be provided as an argument to the
                Error constructor function.<br>

                The stack property will return a stack trace for that error. This is a non-standard property and it’s
                recommended that it is not safe to use in production sites.
            </li>
            <li>Throw, throw new Error()
            </li>
            <li>try, catch, finally
            </li>
            <li>Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code. Obviously these
                tests will initially fail,
                because there is no code to test. The next step is to write some code to make the tests pass. After
                this, the code is refactored
                to make it faster, more readable, and remove any repetition. The code is continually tested at each
                stage to make sure it continues
                to work. This process should be followed in small piecemeal chunks every time a new feature is
                implemented.<br>
                “red-green-refactor” cycle of TDD<br>
                <li>
                Write tests (that initially fail)<br>

                Write code to pass the tests<br>

                Refactor the code<br>

                Test refactored code<br>

                Write more tests for new features
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>Jest<br>
            TDD framework created by Facebook
        </li>
        <li>CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) </li>
