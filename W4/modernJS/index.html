          <li>jQuery<br>
        $ - alias for the the global jQuery object that contains all of jQuery's methods.
        </li>
        <li>Underscor & Lodash<br>
            _.<br>
            Lodash can be thought of as a 'superset' of Underscore as it does everything Underscore 
            does, but also adds some extra features. Lodash also has a modular architecture that allows 
            you to selectively use only the functions that you require in your projects, rather than 
            having to include the whole library.

        <li>library advantages<br>
        optimized and battle-tested, online documentation and community help<br>
        library disadvantages<br>
        must include library with code, increases amount to dowload with possibly performance issues
        might fail to implement functionality and must code own functions to achieve it, can make code slower,
        useful for large team and large projects, useful in supporting older browsers and ironing out any 
        browser-specific bugs or quirks, or if performance isnâ€™t the most important factor.
        must learn library's notation, library may become obsolete

<li>Modular JavaScript<br>
    A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used 
    in other files and by other modules. This helps to keep code organized in separate, reusable files, 
    which improves code maintainability. The code in a module should have a single purpose, and group 
    together functions with distinct functionality. Keeping code modular helps to make it moreloosely 
    coupledand interchangeable, meaning you can easily swap one module for another without affecting 
    other parts of a project. Indeed, small single-purpose modules are the exact opposite of large monolithic 
    libraries as they enable developers to use only the modules that are needed, avoiding any wasted code. 
    Modules also allow a public API to be exposed, while keeping the implementation hidden away inside the module.
</li>
<li>Coupling<br>
    The coupling of code refers to how dependent certain elements or modules of code are on each other. 
    Two pieces of code are said to be tightly coupled if one relies on the other to run. This often occurs 
    if a piece of code makes hard-coded references to another piece of code, requiring it to be used. This 
    will often mean that changes to one piece of code will necessitate changes in the other. On the other hand, 
    two pieces of code are said to loosely coupled if one piece of code can be easily substituted by another without 
    affecting the final outcome. This is often achieved by referring to common methods that are shared by the alternative modules.<br>
    connect()
</li>
<li>Modules<br>
    All code in modules is always in strict mode without the need for 'use strict' and there is no way to opt out of this.<br>
    A module has its own global scope, so any variables created in the top-level of a module can only be accessed within that module.<br>
    The value of this in the top level of a module is undefined , rather than the global object.<br>
    You can't use HTML-style comments in modules (although this isn't very common in any JavaScript program these days).<br>
    Keyword export to specify any values or functions that are to be made available from the module.
</li>
<li>A single variable, function or class in a module that can be imported without having to be explicitly named. Don't have more than one default export.
</li>
<li>compele-translating it from their chosen JavaScript dialect to plain old JavaScript
</li>
<li>Bundlers<br>
    Because fetching a single big file tends to be faster than fetching a lot of tiny ones, web programmers have started using tools that roll their programs 
    (which they painstakingly split into modules) back into a single big file before they publish it to the Web. 
</li>
<li>Minifiers<br>
    These are tools that take a JavaScript program and make it smaller by automatically removing comments and whitespace, renaming bindings, and replacing 
    pieces of code with equivalent code that take up less spa
</li>
<li>Models<br>
    Modelsare objects that implement the functionality for creating, reading, updating and deleting (known as CRUD tasks) specific pieces of information about the application, as well as any other associated logic and behavior. In a to-do list application, for example, there would be a task model providing methods to access all the information about the tasks such as names, due dates and completed tasks. This data will often be stored in a database or some other container.
</li>
<li>Views<br>
    Viewsprovide a visual representation of the model showing all the relevant information. In a web application, this would be the HTML displayed on a web page. Views also provide a way for users to interact with an application, usually via forms. In a to-do list application, the views would display the tasks as an HTML list with checkboxes that a user could tick to say a task had been completed.
</li>
<li>Controllers<br>
    Controllerslink models and views together by communicating between them. They respond to events, which are usually inputs from a user (entering some data into a form, for example), process the information, then update the model and view accordingly. In a to-do list application, the controller functions would respond to the event of a user clicking on a check box and then inform the model that a task had been completed. The model would then update the information about that task.
