      <h3>Week4 OOP</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Encapsulation<br>
            Programming logic inside an object and making methods available to 
            implement the functionality.
        </li>
        <li>Polymorphism<br>
            Various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability 
            to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.
        </li>
        <li>Inheritance<br>
            Take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. 
            We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.
        </li>
        <li>Constructor function defines the properties and methods of an object. 
        
        </li>
        <li>A static method is called by the class directly rather than by instances of the class.
            Static methods are not available to instances of the class.
        </li>
        <li>Prototype<br>
            You cannot add a new property to a constructor function.(Person.nationality = "English";) To add a new property to a constructor, 
            you must add it to the constructor function (this.nationality = "English").
            Or use (Person.prototype.nationality = "English";).<br>
            The prototype can be used to add any new properties and methods after the class has been declared. It should be used to define any 
            properties that will remain the same for every instance of the class. <br>
            A golden rule to remember is:Never use arrays or objects as a default value in prototype.
            This is not a problem if arrays or objects are set as default values from within the constructor 
            function in the class declaration.
        </li>
        <li>Built-in methods to be non-enumerable, and any user-defined methods to be made enumerable. 
        </li>
        <li>monkey patching<br>
            Add more methods to the prototype of JavaScript’s built-in objects.
         </li>
         <li>The instanceof operator only works when using constructor functions to create objects.
         </li>
         <li>A mixin is a way of adding properties and methods of some objects to another object 
             without using inheritance. 
            </li>
            <li>Shallow Copy<br>
                When objects are copied by assignment, they are only copied by reference. This means that 
                another object is not actually created in memory; the new reference will just point to the 
                old object. Any changes that are made to either objects will affect both of them. Arrays and 
                functions are objects, so whenever they’re copied by assignment they will just point to the same 
                object. And when one changes, they all change. When a shallow copy is changed, the original changes too.
            </li>
            <li>Deep Copy<br>
                A deep or hard copy will create a completely new object that has all the same properties as the old object. 
                The difference is that when a hard copy is changed, the original remains the same. 
            </li>
