    <h4>Purpose</h4>
    <p>This project will be a test of my knowledge and skills acquired this semester. It was challenging to find a
      useful API
      that was free. I was excited for studio ghibli and LOTR but neither had much useful information in them. I
      considered making a matching
      game of prophets and their names. I was going to create a local json file, but the church website has been down
      for image links a couple days,
      and I haven’t patience to wait and see if that would work. I then decided a temple matching game with image to
      location would be fun, but there
      are almost 200 of them. I remembered I no longer have photo shop since I’m on a different computer, and it would
      be very time consuming to download
      and resize each one. So, I decided to make a matching game with names to images of superheroes. It’s not quite as
      uplifting, but it is accessible.
    </p>
    <h4>Audience</h4>
    <p>
      I think that any superhero fans will enjoy testing their skills.
      It is specifically intended for my teenage boys and young daughter. I spend too much time doing schoolwork,
      and they should see some benefit from it.
    </p>
    <h4>Data Sources</h4>
    <p>I will be using <a href="https://superheroapi.com/" target="_blank">superheroapi.com </a> for my external API.</p>
    <h4>Initial Module List</h4>
